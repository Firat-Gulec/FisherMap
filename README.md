# Fisher Map
This application has been made for amateur fishermen to pin the locations. The app also shows weather, sun and moon forecasts based on current location. It also shows the time of fishing, according to the solunar theory. Design, bug fixes and localization translations are in progress. This project is still ongoing.. :)
